## Git Worktrees

- **Always use a git worktree** for any code changes. Never work directly on the main working tree.
- Create worktrees inside this repo under `worktrees/<branch-name>`: `git worktree add worktrees/<branch-name> -b <branch-name>`
- Worktrees MUST live within the parent repo folder under `worktrees/` (and should be gitignored). Do not create sibling worktree directories outside the repo.
- This prevents clashes with running production containers and concurrent Claude Code sessions.
